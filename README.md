I am currently in the second year of high school, aiming to develop my career as a future Full Stack developer.
My technical skills include proficiency in Python, MySQL, HTML, and CSS programming languages. I am seeking opportunities that allow me to explore and enhance my skills on both sides of web development, 
from frontend to backend. I am committed to learning and tackling challenges, 
looking to broaden my knowledge to build comprehensive and efficient solutions.
I am open to hands-on experiences and opportunities that enable me to grow as a Full Stack developer.
